# Summary

This is a visualization of my personal learning goals and progress. My curriculum doesn't exactly match the [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) curriculum as I've streamlined the advanced topics and omitted some foundational ones I'm already confident in.

## Intro CS

### Introduction to Computer Science

An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML

**Topics covered**:
`computation`
`imperative programming`
`basic data structures and algorithms`
`and more`
